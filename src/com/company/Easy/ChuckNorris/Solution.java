 *
 * The Goal
 * Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.
 * Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norrisâ€™ method.
 *
 * Rules
 * Here is the encoding principle:
 *
 * The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
 * The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
 * A block is separated from another block by a space
 * Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):
 * - First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
 * - Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series
